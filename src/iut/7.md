Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA)
======================================

In today's practical, you will be given an application. A pretty damn vulnerable
one.

**Your mission**: find, exploit and eventually fix as much vulnerabilities as you
can!

As the application will be running in a Docker container with its own webserver
and database, the isolation level provided by the container should be sufficient
for you to feel free to attack the application in any way you want!

## Setup

Clone [DVWA](https://github.com/K-Phoen/dvwa) and follow the instructions in the
README to get it running.

Once the container is up and running, **setup the database** and use the
credentials "**admin/password**" to log in.

The security level of application can be changed to low, medium or high. Follow
the "DVWA Security" link in the sidebar and choose the desired level (*low* is
probably a good choice to start).

More information on the application is available here: http://www.dvwa.co.uk/
The source is also committed on the DVWA repository, in the `dvwa-1.0.8`
directory.

**Note:** a few interesting tools are also provided in this repository…
